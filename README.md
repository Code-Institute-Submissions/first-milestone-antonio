# Augello Photoword- First Mileston Project

This Website was developed for Code Institute's User Centic Front End Development Project 1 and is an advertising website of myself as photographer to promote my photography services. It's a five pages responsive website, each area is build to make easier the navigation trough the contents and give all the info needed to the customers interested to have shootage services.

## UX
 
This Project is to demonstrate lessons learned in this section HTML and CSS User-Centric Front End Development.

The website was build following the principle Mobile First and the UX is designed following the Bootstrap Grid system. 

The idea was to build a website disegned for customers that are looking for photography shootage services and to give them a brief demonstration of my works as photographer. 
I decided to divide the website in five different sections:

* Home Page
* Photobook
* Services and Prices
* Delivery & Payment Info
* Contact Us

## Basic Structure

The basic structure of each page is the same, this to allow the user a simple navigation.

The structure is as follow:

* Navbar: a simple navigation bar with a burger bar inside of same to divide the various services category of my website and socials icons.
* Image background
* Jumbotron: inspirated from the Wishkey project of Code Institute's User Centic Front End Development Module, this Bootstrap based Jumbotron contain a sign up form, always inspired the Whiskey Project, that allows the users to sign up and receive a discount code.
* Footer: A responsive footer in wich is implemented the use of Font Awesome and [Ianlunn`s](http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/)
 Hover.css.

## _Home Page_

This is the original section were my idea started. The basic idea was to give a brief introduction of myself and of my best works.

In this page we can find:

* Presentation Section: Build following the responsive grid it contains a brief presentation of me as phoographer.
* Customers Review: A bootstrap carousel inspirated form with customers review, this is important for the users to see what the people think about my services.
* Body Sections: A section with the example of the best services offered build with a responsive grid.


## _Photobook_

This webpage was build to give to the user a better idea of the work I do as photographer.
The structure is simply and easy for the user. There is a bootstrap grid system of 3x6, three column and 6 raws for each column. 

Following the principle of the Mobile First the page was build for small devices in girst so it is possible to see how below a widht of 768px the is only one 






Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
